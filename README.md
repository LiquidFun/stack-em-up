# Stack 'em Up

A little puzzle platformer made for Brackeys Game Jam 2021. The game is about maneuvering multiple players through single screen levels.

## You can play it [here](https://crysaac.itch.io/stack-em-up)!

The theme of the jam was "Stronger Together". We incorporated it in the game by having multiple characters which need to cooperate to get through the levels. Also players can stack on each other to gain strength.

We made all art, code and sound effects ourselves.

If you want, you can switch on the timer in the settings menu and send us your time in the ending screen!


The controls will be shown in-game but in case you forget them:

* Move with WASD
* Jump with W or SPACE
* Switch controlled player with TAB
* Stack players with E, unstack with Q
* Throw players with SHIFT
* Reset with R
* Open Menu with ESCAPE
